# shopco

shopco is an illustration of the complexities of decision making in the process of machine learning model creation, and of the value of human steering using [scikit-yellowbrick](http://www.scikit-yb.org/en/develop/), illustrated via a data science choose-your-own adventure story.

## The Data

The data can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). 

The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.
More details on current and past projects on related topics are available on https://www.researchgate.net/project/Fraud-detection-5 and the page of the DefeatFraud project
